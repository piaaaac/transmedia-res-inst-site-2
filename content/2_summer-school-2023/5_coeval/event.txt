MATTEO SCOLARI, Art director/graphic designer class 1990. Since the beginning, music, fashion, comics and underground urban cultures influenced his work, and are still his signature source of inspiration. He collaborated with many communication agencies, such as Leviathan & We Are Social. Over the course of the last year he focused on experimenting with AI, filling it with all his love for pop culture, and thus creating short storytellings such as ‘Ramen no kaibutsu’, or the playing card deck ‘Mana’ inspired by Magic. In his practice he likes to mix graphic design & AI to create a rather personal outcome.
