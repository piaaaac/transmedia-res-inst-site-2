Fulldescription: In this 5 day workshop participants will be experimenting with DIY and DIWO/DIT biofabrication techniques for the fabrication of soft robots and inflatable structures. We will be cultivating and crafting some of our own materials such as bacterial cellulose and alginate/gelatine bioplastics and investigating their material properties as inflatable structures.					At first we will look at materials and techniques that are already widely being used for the fabrication of soft robots and inflatable structures like silicone, PVC or other found materials in order to understand the fundamentals of fabricating inflatable structures.
