Fulldescription:

The workshop ’OltrePelle' is designed to explore the potential of algae and bacterial cellulose for textile futures in the sextech industry in terms of growing living materials and creating speculative scenarios for second skins, eco-erotic haptic sensors and bdsm harnesses.
~
Learning new methods of making sensory surfaces for wearables and envisioning how biotechnology and new materials will respond for erotical self-pleasures, opening a dialogue to reclaim society's taboos, stigmas and explore sexuality through technology.
~
What if we could create a sustainable, symbiotic future with our bodily fluids?
What if we use bacteria to empower our bodies and go beyond the pleasure experience?
How can technology help us to explore and reclaim our sexual liberation?
~
 
Bruixes_Lab is a nomadic lab where biohacking and witchcraft rituals are performed to create speculative scenarios about intimate care and pleasure and to destigmatize taboos around sexuality. An interactive space where intimate biotechnology, bdsm, transfeminist and DIY practices intertwine in symbiosis with natural environments, microbiology and bodily fluids.
